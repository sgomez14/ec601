This is the README for Project2

For this project I used the Twitter API to retrieve tweets from local Bostonians that tweet about restaurants in Boston and the Greater Boston area.

These tweets are then processed by the Google NLP API which accesses them for positive language about restaurants.

The results of the Google NLP processing are saved to a JSON.

I then had to manually edit the JSON files to add information about the restaurant's address and latitude and longitude. 

This JSON file is then loaded by foodMap.py, which uses the Folium Mapping AP to mark all the tweets on a map.

After running the foodMap.py, a user can click on the different waypoint markings to see what was tweeted about that restaurant.

Clicking on a waypoint allows a user to see the restaurant's address, website, and the contents of the tweet.

To run foodMap.py, download this foloder and be sure to have the folium map library installed on your computer.

You can find instructions for downloading folium at https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/.


MVP:
- an interactive map with waypoints indicating tweets about a restaurant at the location
- clicking on waypoint displays window with restaurant name, address, tweet, and restaurant website

User Stories:
- user can easily zoom in and out of the map
- user can click on restaurant website link
